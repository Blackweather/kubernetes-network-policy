# kubernetes-network-policy

This repository was created to support conducting laboratory classes of Security and Reliability of Cloud Systems.

There are excercises on various use cases of Kubernetes Network Policies that require you to fill in YAML manifests to make the network policy work.

Each exercise includes the instructions to make it work and defines the desired state of the environment after the exercise is completed.

## Starting point
To start the exercises, set up **Docker**, **kubectl** and **Minikube** on your local machine.
For instructions on setting up the required tools, see the [*ex0-env-setup*](https://github.com/Blackweather/kubernetes-network-policy/tree/master/ex0-env-setup) directory.

If you already have the required tools installed, start with *ex1-??* directory.

## Additional resources
If something doesn't seem to work and the laboratory instructions do not seem to help, you can always refer to the [Official Kubernetes Network Policy documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
